# SchedlyQ
## Title  
**Priority-Based Task Scheduler using Greedy Algorithm**
## Abstract  
In today’s fast-paced digital world, efficient task scheduling plays a vital role in improving performance and productivity. This project implements a web-based task scheduler that prioritizes tasks based on their importance using a Greedy Algorithm. Users input tasks with assigned priority values, and the system arranges them so that high-priority tasks are executed first. The approach uses a simple priority queue mechanism in a dynamic web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensures easy use, real-time scheduling, and an intuitive visual experience without involving complex parameters like arrival or burst times.
## Features  
- Add tasks with a custom priority value.  
- Display task list in original order.  
- Schedule tasks so that the highest-priority tasks appear first.  
- Clean, interactive web interface: HTML + CSS + JavaScript.
## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Priority queue logic implemented using array sorting in JS.
## How to Use  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Enter a task name and assign a priority value (e.g., 1-10).  
4. Click **Add Task** to add it to the list.  
5. When you’re ready, click **Schedule** to see tasks sorted in descending priority order.
## Future Enhancements  
- Add “Remove Task” or “Clear All” functionality.  
- Add editing/updating of existing tasks.  
- Implement visual animations or drag-and-drop for task ordering.  
- Expand to include more scheduling criteria (e.g., arrival time, deadline).
